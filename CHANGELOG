R3.5.0 Sometime in autumn 2014
==============================

Extended type system with signed and unsigned ints: int8, int16,
int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64. 
You need to to the following in your code:
Rename all cligen syntax types.
        int      -> int32
        number   -> int32
For example in cli syntax files: <x:int> -> <x:int32>. 
'int' will remain as an alias for int32.

Rename types :
	CGV_INT  -> CGV_INT32
	CGV_LONG -> CGV_INT64
Rename cv access functions:
	 cv_int_get -> cv_int32_get
	 cv_int_set -> cv_int32_set
	 cv_long_get -> cv_int64_get
	 cv_long_set -> cv_int64_set
For the new int types, see Section 5.1 in the CLIgen tutorial

A new decimal64 type is added. Decimal64 defined in the YANG standard
(RFC6020) is a 64-bit integer with a fraction-index numbers defining a
number of decimals. For example, a decimal64 with 4 fraction-index is
written as: 123.4567. Ranges allowed for decimal64 as well.

Autoheader support. clicon_config.h.in may be generated by autoheader,
but is still part of the release.

Cligen variable vectors (cvec) extended with 'name'. New functions:
	char *cvec_name_get(cvec *vr);
	char *cvec_name_set(cvec *vr, char *name);

A new module: cligen_buf.[ch] is added. This adds a simple variable buffer allocation
(cbuf) functionality. Example:
	cbuf *cb = cbuf_new();
	cprintf(cb, "%d %s", 43, "go");
        write(1, cbuf_get(cb), cbuf_len(cb)) < 0)
        cbuf_free(cb);

The string type is extended with a length keyword. This adds the
possibility to limit the length of a string. Example: <s:string
length[2:10]>; # string length must bebetween 2 and 10 <s:string
length[10]>; # string length must be shorter than 10

Integer ranges can be defined with only an upper limit, lower limit can be 
suppressed: 
   <x:int32 range[125]>;

Added a 'show' field in the variable syntax to distinguish between a name of a variable used for reference and how it is displayed in the CLI:
	<x:int32 show:number>;
Here, 'x' is used to reference the variable in callbacks, but 'number' is used when displaying the variable.

Added a function to get the calling callback function:
cligen_fn_str_get(). This may be useful in case the callback is not
known and is primarily used in the ongoing python port.

Empty list parser bug fixed: "a;{}" now supported, not only "a{}".

Parser bug fixed: "a;<a:int>" did not recognize the 2nd 'a', ie
commands and variables on the same level could not have the same name.

Made cligen compilable with g++.


R3.4.0 September 2013
=====================
Changed 'range' variable syntax, the old did not allow negative numbers.
NOTE: You need to change all variable syntax statements of the form:
    <a:int range:3-89>
to 
    <a:int range[3:89]>
The old syntax will be kept for some releases.

Setting of terminal length, not hardcode to 80:
   cligen_terminal_length_set(h, 160);

Added help-text and cligen variable vector to expanded variables. An
expand callback now has a 'vars' and 'helptext' argument:
NOTE: You need to change all expand callbacks in your user C-code:
   int expandcb(cligen_handle h, char *fn_str, cg_var *arg, 
                int *nr, char ***commands);
to
   int expandcb(cligen_handle h, char *fn_str, cvec *vars, cg_var *arg, 
                int *nr, char ***commands, char ***helptexts);
The helptext variable is set in the same way as 'commands'. If it is left empty, 
the help-text in the specification is used.
'vars' is a cligen variable vector of the command line. Same semantics as in cligen
calbacks.

cligen_print() now prints a complete parsable syntax when brief=0. It was
previously not complete for variables. It now prints also expand and regex.

Removed byacc support. It leaks memory and can't get the generated code to work.

Support for clang compiler

Added a userdata field for cligen_objects (co) to add app-specific
fields. The default field is removed and can be implemented by
userdata.

Added pt_apply that applies a function call recursively on all cg_obj:s in a parse-tree

Added cligen_logsyntax[_set]() as a debug-function to track dynamic
cligen syntax, including tree-references and completion.

Removed the --gl-select configure option by making it mandatory.

R3_3_0 April 2013
=================

Variable syntax: '<' <name> 'type:'<type>'>' is no longer supported. 
Use instead: '<' <name>':'<type>'>'.
NOTE: You need to change all variable syntax statements of the form:
   <a type:int> 
to 
   <a:int> 

Syntax for referencing sub-trees (like function-calls) have been
introduced. The new reference operator is '@'. A subtree is unfolded
in the place of the reference, much like a function call or macro. A syntax
can even refence itself.
Example:
   T:
   a @T;
gives a recursive syntax on the form 'a a a a a ...'.

Three new variable types introduced: bool, uuid, and (ISO) time. Examples:
   uuid: f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479
   time: 2008-09-21T18:57:21.003456
   bool: true, false, on, off

Complete rewrite of cligen_var API. Complete rewrite of and rename of
varrec->cvec API.
Both types are now hidden C-variables using handles and accessed via
get/set functions. cvec being a vector of cv:s.
Example:
   cvec *vr;
   cg_var *cv = NULL;
   while ((cv = cvec_each(vr, cv)) != NULL) {
      str = cv_name_get(cv);
   }
See cligen_tutorial for a documentation of the API

R3_2_0 January 2012.
====================

New variable and expand syntax. Example:
 <name:int fn()>
Used to be: <name type:int expand:fn>
NOTE: You need to change all statements of the form:
<name:int expand:fn> to <name:int fn()>

List of callbacks. Example:
  a b, x("foo"), y("bar");
  a b, z("fie");
Both x, y and z will be called when 'a b' is typed.

regexp variables re-introduced. 
Example: 
  <name:string regexp:"[a-z]+[0-8]+\\.[0-9]">;
  <name:string regexp:"(ab|a)b*c">;

Refactoring (no API changes):
1. Parse-code - Merged the two yacc parsers into one. This gives
better performance but more importantly less complex code. Documented in
docs/block-chart.pdf. 
2. Search and insertion is made using binary search instead of linear. Load 30K syntax 
lines now takes 0.2s instead of 13.2s.

R3_1_0 2011-11-19
=================
NOTE: API changes (You need to search and replace in your code):
 cli_output -> cligen_output
 pt_print -> cligen_parsetree_print
 cligen_expand(h) -> cligen_expand(h, name)
 cligen_parsetree_set(h, pt) -> cligen_parsetree_add(h, name, pt)
                             -> cligen_parsetree_del(h, name)
 cligen_parsetree(h) -> cligen_parsetree(h, name)
 cligen_parse_*(str/f, name,...) -> cligen_parse(h, name, str/f,...)

New API functions:
  char *cligen_mode(cligen_handle ch);
  int cligen_mode_set(cligen_handle ch, char *mode);
  int cligen_tabmode(cligen_handle ch);
  int cligen_tabmode_set(cligen_handle ch, int mode);

R3_0_3 2013-06-30 (branched)
=================
Added help-text to expanded variables. An expand callback now has a 'comments' argument:
NOTE: You need to change all expand callbacks in your user C-code:
   int expandcb(cligen_handle h, char *fn_str, cg_var *arg, int *nr, char ***commands);
to
   int expandcb(cligen_handle h, char *fn_str, cg_var *arg, int *nr, char ***commands, char ***comments);
The comments variable is set in the same way as 'commands'. If it is left empty, 
the help-text in the specification is used.

Setting of terminal length, not hardcode to 80:
cligen_terminal_length_set(h, 160);

Support for clang, and copt as config-option

R3_0_2 2011-10-27
=================
url was limited: protocol only allowed some, and trailing slash was mandatory
vt100 application cursor bug disabling arrow keys

R3_0_1 2011-10-19
=================
Callbacks signatures have changed to:
  int cb(void *handle, varrec args, cg_var *arg)
CLI specification syntax has radically changed. Example:
  prompt=foo;
  command1("helptext"){
    sub1("help"),callback(arg);
    sub2, hide;
  }
New handles and cleaned up API.
More or less complete manual.
